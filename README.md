# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

In this repository I am doing my best to implement the challenges from 
[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) using the not-yet-released
[roc programming language](https://www.roc-lang.org/).

These implementations are my own learning journey. Feel free to take inspiration 
from them, but I am not sure how "ideomatic roc" these implementations are.

Have a great day ðŸ™‚

## Running all the tests

This is the command I am using to run all the tests in this repository:

```
find ./ -type f -name "*.roc" -exec roc test {} \;
```
